#Dependencies are an integral part of this
#We need to add forge and minecraft to run the game
#However, we also need to require the Gun mod, as well as Obfuscate
#We need the Gun Mod so we can register guns and other related stuff
#We need Obfuscate because it is a required dependency of the Gun Mod

#The fields marked with mandatory need to be present when loading the game
#They are present in the IDE as we added them to our build.gradle file
